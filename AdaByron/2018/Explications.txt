First Question Explication
- 1st: Save input's.
- 2nd: We create a Struct called Friends where we save init and end hours of each event.
- 3rd: We create a Friend vector that will be all the person's we need. Whe have a self contemplation in friends vector (line 47).
- 4th: Run all hours and comprobate if we need a new friend in friendComprobation function.
- 5th: Solapation criteria --> They are 2 cases we have solapation (X2 because we have to comprobate it in both side). Examples:
  This conditions include if both of hours are inside another one. (Example: First hour --> 1-4, Second hour --> 2-3).
  - First Hour:  1   4
    Second Hour:   3   5
  - First Hour:      4   6
    Second Hour:   3   5
- 6th: Case solapation in each friend--> Create a new Friend and add it to vector. Else --> Add hour to not solapated friend.     
- 7th: Return friend's vector size-1 (Because we have a self contemplation in vector).
